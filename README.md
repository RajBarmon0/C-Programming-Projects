1.If an employee's salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross salary
as per the following company policy.

Allowance is 10% of basic salary and Dearness allowance is 70% of basic salary.

2. Below is a simple C program that calculates the library fine based on the number of days a book
is returned late. The program takes the number of late days as input and displays the
appropriate fine or a message indicating membership cancellation if the book is returned after
30 days.
Explanation:
1. Input Reading:
○ The program prompts the user to enter the number of days the book is late using
scanf.

2. Fine Calculation:
○ The program uses a series of if-else statements to determine the fine based
on the number of late days:
■ 0 or less days: No fine, the book is returned on time.
■ 1 to 5 days: Fine is 500 taka.
■ 6 to 10 days: Fine is 1000 taka.
■ 11 to 30 days: Fine is 1500 taka.
■ More than 30 days: Membership is canceled.
3. Output:
○ The program prints the appropriate message based on the input days.
You can compile and run this program using a C compiler to test its functionality.
